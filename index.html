    <h2>Historical Narrative</h2>
    <p>The Seeber family story spans four branches—Teitelbaum, Schlesinger, Endervelt, and Swerbilov—whose journeys move from Hungary, Poland, and Russia to the United States in the early 20th century. The Teitelbaum family left Cushow, Hungary around 1921–1922, seeking safety from conscription and opportunity in America. They attended night school, worked in local factories, and found community through the Hungarian social club MUNKOS OTHUN. The Schlesinger siblings, orphaned in Budapest after losing both parents to tuberculosis, were sponsored to the U.S. by their eldest brother Carl; their resilience and trade skills grew into successful enterprise supporting the WWII effort. The Endervelts emigrated from Poland in 1904, overcoming poverty through early work, education, and artistic talent—while maintaining close ties despite geographic distance. From Orsha, Russia, the Swerbilov line arrived to avoid conscription, building livelihoods in Brooklyn and Annapolis and staying connected through the Orsha Young Friends Benevolent Society. Across these branches, common threads are migration for safety and opportunity, reliance on community sponsorship, commitment to education and enterprise, and enduring intergenerational family bonds.</p>

    <h2>About: Detailed Historical Narrative</h2>
    <h3>Teitelbaum Family (Hungary → United States)</h3>
    <p>Morris Teitelbaum and Ethel Sempliner lived in Cushow, Hungary, operating a restaurant/tavern and bottling seltzer. Their relatively comfortable life changed under the pressure of conscription for their son Henry and the determination of their eldest daughter Sophie to emigrate. Around 1921–1922, Morris sold their businesses and the entire family moved to the United States, sponsored by Sempliner relatives. They enrolled in night school, worked in a sweater factory, and joined the Hungarian social club MUNKOS OTHUN, which anchored their social life and helped preserve culture. Weekends together and summers at Greenwood Lake reinforced the family’s tight bonds; after Morris’s death, Ethel remained central to these gatherings.</p>

    <h3>Schlesinger Family (Budapest → United States)</h3>
    <p>Julius (Gyula) Schlesinger and Ilka Heimler died of tuberculosis when their children were young, leaving Carl, Julia (Jolan), Alex (Sandor), and Eugene (Jeno’) orphaned. The siblings were split among relatives and rotated homes for meals. As they grew, each trained for work: Carl as a tinsmith, Alex in bookkeeping, Julia as a household helper, and Eugene as a retail clerk. Carl emigrated first to avoid conscription and later sponsored his siblings. In New Jersey, Carl co-founded Pollak Manufacturing, which expanded to multiple plants in Kearny and supplied metal parts for U.S. military branches during World War II. The Schlesingers prioritized education and mutual support, financing schooling for relatives and employees’ children and maintaining lifelong closeness.</p>

    <h3>Endervelt Family (Poland → United States)</h3>
    <p>Morris Endervelt and Gussie Fishman emigrated from Poland in 1904 amid difficult living conditions. In New York, the family faced poverty and crowded housing; most children worked early to help support the household. Nancy, the eldest, became a cashier and bookkeeper and sang in employee choruses at Namm’s Department Store. Betty (Billie) studied piano with Leopold Damrosh and later accompanied San Francisco Opera singers. Thanks to the older siblings’ income, the youngest, David, was able to attend college—an example of the family’s commitment to education and advancement despite hardship. The Endervelts stayed closely connected through letters, calls, and visits, even across states.</p>

    <h3>Swerbilov Family (Russia → United States)</h3>
    <p>Eliazar Swerbilov and Hanetta Polikoff lived in Orsha, Russia. Their sons Solomon (Sol) and Jack emigrated to avoid conscription, settling among relatives in Brooklyn. At Ellis Island, Jack’s surname was recorded as “Swerbilow,” a spelling that continued for his branch. The family joined the Orsha Young Friends Benevolent Society, which offered social and practical support. Solomon worked as a typographer and financially helped his widowed sister Molly raise her four daughters. Jack became a tailor and shop owner in Annapolis, serving civilians and Naval Academy members; his family later included a WWII Air Force pilot and educators. Across the branch, adaptation, mutual aid, and cultural continuity shaped their American lives.</p>

    <h3>Shared Themes & Legacy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Migration for safety and opportunity:</strong> Each branch left Europe to escape conscription, poverty, or instability and to build better futures in America.</li>
      <li><strong>Community sponsorship:</strong> Relatives and social organizations provided food, shelter, employment, and belonging.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptation and resilience:</strong> Night school, apprenticeships, factory work, and enterprise helped families overcome language barriers and hardship.</li>
      <li><strong>Education and enterprise:</strong> From Pollak Manufacturing to Star Stationery and artisan trades, family initiatives supported war efforts and community livelihoods.</li>
      <li><strong>Enduring family bonds:</strong> Regular gatherings, correspondence, and intermarried branches sustained strong ties across generations.</li>
