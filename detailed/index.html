            <h2>The Teitelbaum Family (Hungary → United States)</h2>
            <button class="toggle" aria-expanded="true">Collapse</button>
            <div class="content"><p>Morris and Ethel Teitelbaum worked very hard and had a relatively comfortable family life. In the town of Cushow, in Hungary, they owned and operated a restaurant/tavern type of business. In conjunction with this business, my grandfather, Morris, bottled seltzer (club soda). My Aunt Sophie, the eldest daughter, who was about 18 years old, corresponded with Mildred Sempliner, one of her cousins who lived in the United States. Mildred knew about and wrote to Sophie of an older man who lived in Standish , Michigan. He had recently been widowed and was very lonely. He was looking for a Hungarian wife, and had his own business, his own home, and a fairly comfortable kind of life to offer. Aunt Sophie had always dreamed of going to the United States and decided this was her opportunity to emigrate. Sophie announced to her parents that she was going to the United States to marry this man and her parents said NO! Since Sophie was a very independent and determined young woman, she persisted with arguments constantly. Her father insisted that he would not permit his young daughter to travel alone to a foreign country to marry a stranger. During this same period, Henry, the next to oldest child, periodically was hidden in the chimney of the fireplace whenever soldiers came looking for eligible young men for conscription into the army. Finally, around 1921or 1922, to bring peace back to the whole family, regarding the problem of Sophie, and also Henry's on-going dilemma, Morris sold his two businesses, the family home, and moved the entire family to the United States.</p><p>To become an immigrant to the United States, each foreigner had to be sponsored by a citizen of this country. This meant that someone had to take the responsibility for providing food and shelter to the immigrants as well as making sure that each immigrant would have employment. This was to guarantee that these foreigners would not become a financial burden upon the government. The Sempliner relatives sponsored the whole Teitelbaum family as to food and shelter. Since none of the family spoke English, my grandfather and all the children enrolled in a night school program immediately. As soon as they were able to understand and speak some English, Sophie, Selena and Magda went to work in a sweater factory where they did hand sewing or finishing of the sweaters being manufactured.</p><p>During this time, they all went to the MUNKOS OTHUN a Hungarian social club where they met many other Hungarian immigrants. There were dances, speakers, billiards, cards, a restaurant, concerts and many other activities to aid them in social contacts and activities. It was here that Magda Teitelbaum met Eugene (Jeno') Schlesinger and Selena Teitelbaum met Harry Heisler, leading to two marriages. Henry Teitelbaum and Stanley Teitelbaum met their respective wives some years later---- Henry, through a marriage broker (a matchmaker), met and married Deborah (Debbie), whose family had emigrated from England, while Stanley, through friends, met and married Tillie Gandelman. Sophie eventually married the widower, Sol Marks, from Michigan and lived the rest of her life in Standish Michigan. Sophie lost her first and only child before he was a year old. The marriage was not a happy one and after many years, Sophie divorced Sol Marks. However, during the years of her marriage to Sol, Sophie became very successful financially, buying and selling homes, buying and selling the contents of homes, and lending money in the form of mortgages. She amassed a considerable amount of money in these enterprises so she was able to be financially independent for the rest of her life. Eventually, she married Ted Curkovich, a man who was much younger than she. This, too, was not a happy marriage, and eventually ended in divorce. She continued to reside in Michigan, away from her family. Though she missed them, she was unable to leave all her financial affairs unattended. As a child, I had spent a summer visiting with her. As an adult, when she became ill, it was necessary for me to go to Michigan to help her settle into a nursing home, to sell her home, and to manage her affairs for her (with her help) until she eventually died.</p><p>Through the marriage of Magda to Eugene (Jeno') Schlesinger, my grandfather, Morris, and his two sons, Henry and Stanley, eventually went to work in a business owned by Eugene's brother, Carl (Calman) Schlesinger. (More on this topic will follow in the story of the Schlesinger family's immigration to the United States). Throughout their married lives, the familes of Eugene & Magda Schlesinger, Harry & Selena Teitelbaum, and Henry & Debbie Teitelbaum remained a close and loving group. They spent every weekend visiting each other in their respective homes for dinners and conversation and play amongst the cousins. During the summer months, every weekend, in two cars , they all travelled to Greenwood Lake for great family picnics, swimming and games. After the death of Morris, their mother Ethel was always a part of these weekends. Stanley and Tillie and their children lived in Syracuse, New York, away from the rest of the family who all resided in Newark and Kearny, New Jersey. However, there was always a close contact between all of them by mail or telephone and periodic visits.</p></div>

            <h2>The Schlesinger Family (Hungary → United States)</h2>
            <button class="toggle" aria-expanded="true">Collapse</button>
            <div class="content"><p>I do not know much about the kind of life that Julius and Ilka Schlesinger had except the following. The family lived in a part of Budapest in Hungary. When Eugene (Jeno') Schlesinger, the youngest child, was about 6-8 years old, his father, Julius, died of tuberculosis. A year or two later, his mother also succumbed to the same illhess, thus leaving their children orphaned. Various aunts and uncles each took one child to sleep in their respective homes. Then it was arranged that these children would rotate amongst these homes for their meals, meaning that each of the Schlesinger children would go to a different house every night for dinner so that they would get together withand know each of their relatives. Since each child lived singly at a different home and ate at a different home, these three brothers and their sister hardly spent any time together except, perhaps, at school during recesses and lunch periods. They missed each other terribly the rest of the time. Unfortunately, splitting the family in this way was verynecessary. Because none of the families could financially afford to take more than one child into their respective homes, this arrangement continued for some time. Eventually, as the children grew a little older, they had to prepare themselves for the future and financially help the families with whom they lived.</p><p>Uncle Carl, the eldest, became an apprentice to a tinsmith; Uncle Alex, the most intellectual of the children, had some training in bookkeeping; Auntie (Julia or Jolan) was sent to work as a household helper (where she was terribly overworked as a maid and cook); Eugene (Jeno') was an apprentice as a clerk in a retail business (as a store keeper).</p><p>As soon as Uncle Carl had mastered tinsmithing sufficiently and had saved enough money ,(and to avoid being conscripted into the Hungarian Army for World War ), he emigrated from Hungary to the United States where he found employment as a tinsmith. He saved his money and eventually, over anumber of years, he sponsored each ofhis brothers and sister to come to the United States. First he sponsored his sister Jolan, then his brother Eugene, and finally his brother Alex (Sandor). Each, in turn, came to live in his home with his family, until each was fluent with the new language and each was able to support himself and move out to live on his own with his own family. Julia (Jolan) was the exception in that she never married and continued to live with Carl and Regina for the rest of her life. However, she was selfsupporting, eventually opening her own business - a retail store for infants and children's clothing. (I, as a teenager, worked in this store part-time after school and Saturdays and I loved it.)</p><p>After getting settled in this country, Uncle Carl, became a member of the MUNKAS OTHUN, a Hungarian social club where he met and ultimately married Regina Gottlieb. Here, also, he met the Teitelbaum family who eventually also becamemembers. He came to know them through the growing friendship of Magda and Eugene and ultimately was responsible for giving employment to the Teitelbaum men in the Pollak Manufacturing Company. This was a metalsmithing company that he and two other men started. It was a most successful enterprise, which eventually grew into four tremendous factory plants in the town of Kearny. They manufactured all kinds of parts for equipment for each of the military branches of the United States in preparation for and during World War II.</p><p>Eugene Schlesinger went to work for a wholesale toy and stationery business, (the Star Stationery Co.), and when he felt he was able to financially support himself and a family, he left the home of Carl and Regina to marry Magda Teitelbaum and start a family of their own. He ultimately became a partner in the Star Stationery Co., where I, as a teenager, worked in the office and learned to type and file and do all sorts of clerical work. (Incidentally, my brother, sister and I were unbelievably well supplied with all kinds of toys, games, sleds, bicycles, skates, school supplies, etc.!!1)</p><p>Carl's brother Alex was the only child of the family who had been conscripted into the Hungarian Army for World War I. (Carl had emigrated and Eugene had been too young.) During the war, Alex had been very badly wounded and lost one lung. After the war, he had pneumonia several times, and was always rather frail and sickly as a result of his war wounds. Since it was very difficult for anyone in poor health to ímmigrate into the United States, it was many years before Carl was able to bring Alex , first to Canada, and eventually to the United States. Alex worked for Carl's company as a bookkeeper and also lived with Regina and Carl in their home, together with Jolan, for many years. Finally all the brothers and sister were together in the United States (Eugene lived nearby and they saw each other very frequently). Having missed so much of their childhood together, they thereafter remained a very close family all their lives.</p><p>Alex had become a very fine bridge player andhad met another brige player, Jess Torrence, who wasa school teacher by profession. He continued to have very poor health, suffering a number of bouts of pneumonia and ultimately was stricken with tuberculosis. Despite his failing health, they eventually married. There were no children and within oneyear of their marriage, hesuccumbed to tuberculosis.</p><p>Due to their childhood experiences, all of theSchlesingers, throughout their lives, continued to help support members of their family who had remained in Europe, both monetarily and with scarce medications during the war and post-war periods. Carl also helped finance the college educations of a number of the children of his employees. He and Julia (Jolan), together, financed my college education during a period when my parents were still struggling financially. They caredabout family values and helped in every way they could to support these values.</p></div>

            <h2>The Endervelt Family (Poland → United States)</h2>
            <button class="toggle" aria-expanded="true">Collapse</button>
            <div class="content"><p>The Endervelt family came from Poland. I have not been able to learn the why or how they came to the United States, other than the fact that life there was very diﬁcult. They emigrated from Poland in 1904, when Nancy, the eldest child, was only four years old. There was approximately two years between each of the children, so Nancy and Jack were probably the only two children who were born in Poland. The rest of the children were born in the United States. The family had a very diﬁcult time, ﬁnancially, for a long time. I do know that they lived in very crowded conditions and that Nancy's bed, for a long time, was the kitchen table. All of the children, with the exception of the youngest child, had to go to work very early in their lives in order to help with the family's income. Nancy was able to complete school only through the ninth grade and then she went to work, ﬁrst as a cashier and later a bookkeeper, for Namm's Department Store. Becauseshe hada very lovely singing voice, Nancy did have some voice lessons. She particularly enjoyed singing in a chorus she had joined there and performed in some of the performances which were given by and for the employees of Namm's. After her marriage to Solomon Swerbilov, who was able to earn a fair living, she no longer worked at a job, but rather concentrated on raising her family. Her sister Betty (Billie) studied piano with Leopold Damrosh (brother of Walter Damrosh) who was the precursor of the Julliard School of Music. She eventuallycoachedand accompanieda number of singers of the San Francisco Opera Co. after she and Sioma Burk were married and living in San Francisco. Dorothy worked as a salesgirl in a bakery owned by the family of Isidor Thompson, who eventually became her husband. Isidor, who became a structural engineer, invented the ﬁrst bagel- making machine. The older brothers also had to go to work very early in their lives to help the family ﬁnancially. With all ofthe older the children working, the youngest, David Endervelt, was able to go on to college and get a further education than his siblings. Both Billie and Dorothy lived with their respective families in California, but the rest of brothers and Nancy lived with their families in New York. However, throughout their lives, they maintained a very close and supportive relationship with each other.</p></div>

            <h2>The Swerbilov / Seeber Family (Russia → United States)</h2>
            <button class="toggle" aria-expanded="true">Collapse</button>
            <div class="content"><p>Of Boris (Swerbilov) Seeber's paternal great grandparents, I have been unable to learn any information. My short history of hisgrandparents consists only of theirnamesandsome of their children. I do know there was one son (whose name I have been unable to determine) who remained in Russia and was still there when one of the children (Sol) returned to visit his mother and brother, the only two still living at that time. Boris (Swerbilov) Seeber's paternal grandparents lived in Russia , in a town called Orsha. Their two eldest sons, Solomon (Sol) and Jack emigrated to the United States (There is some question as to which one came ﬁrst and which one came second) in order to avoid conscription into the Russian army. They cach lived with Mendel Polikoff, a cousin, in Brooklyn till they were able to support themselves. When Sol ﬁrst arrived at Ellis Island, his name remained unchanged (Solomon Swerbilov), but whenJackarrived at Ellis Island,hisnamedwasmispelled with a w instead of a v". Thereafter, he was Jack Swerbilow, as was all of his family following. Many of the family moved to an area on Herkimer Street in Brooklyn where the Polikoff relatives lived. They also all belonged to an organization called THE ORSHA YOUNG FRIENDS BENEVOLENT SOCIETY, named after the town in Russia from which they had all emigrated. This organization, plus the proximity of many family members, provided them with much needed mutual support and social activities in a foreign land. Solomon Swerbilov was a journeyman typographer by training when he arrived in the United States and had no trouble ﬁnding a job. He eventually went to live with his sister Molly who had also come to this country and had been married to William Conovich. When William Conovich died at a very early age, Molly was left a widow with four very young girls, Rose, Rachel, and twins- Sarah & Gertrude. It was at this time that Sol moved in with his sister. For a number of years, he helped ﬁnancially to support and raise the children. Even after he met and married Nancy Kate Endervelt Swerbilov, he continued with ﬁnancial aid to his sister and her family for many years till the girls were able to get jobs for themselves. Sol and Nancy lived in Brooklyn where their ﬁrst child, Boris was born. They later moved to Sunnyside in Queenswhere Boris and his brother,Zarvin, lived till they each married and moved on with their lives. Nancy & Sol also had a small bungalow in Lake Hiawatha, New Jersey where they and their sons spent their summers. It was here that Boris Swerbilov met Dorothy Schlesinger and it was love at ﬁrst sight for both. When Boris enlisted in the Air Force, he and Dorothy corresponded every day for four years, making plans for their marriage and future after he returned from service to civilian life. They carried out those plans, as soon as they could, which meant that Dorothy left college at the end of her second year in college. After their marriage, Dorothy went to work while Boris returned to college to ﬁnish his college degree and then on to law school. In law school, Boris was advised to change his name to a name which was easier to pronounce and remember. It was also believed that it would be better for him to have a name which sounded less Russian since the United States was in a 'cold war' with Russia at the time. Swerbilov was legally changed in the courts to Seeber. Following graduation from law school, life changed a great deal. Kathryn Seeber, our ﬁrst child, was born, and Boris went to work as an attorney. Two more children came along, Stephen Alan Seeber and Michael John Seeber. Eventually, Boris Seeber owned his own law practice, with Dorothy assisting him as secretary and bookkeeper. She also taught sewing and dressmaking at night in the local Adult School. Only after their children had reached junior high school and high school, was Dorothy able to return to college in the evenings, after work, to complete her degree. Tragically, Boris developed a terminal illness and lived only long enough to see that his three children and Dorothy had graduated college. He also had the great pleasure of seeing his ﬁrst two grandchildren. He adored Julie, and then her brother, Eric, and used to rave about them to our friends, constantly telling them that they should have grandchildren because they were so wonderful. Sadly, he died too young to see how his children developed and succeded in their lives, for he would have been very proud of them. How sad that he never had the pleasure of knowing his two daughters-in-law or enjoying the rest of his grandchildren. How sad, too, that none of his grandchildren remember him because they were too young or not yet born when he died.</p></div>
